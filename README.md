# 🚀 TechVibes 2025 Website 

Welcome to the official repository for our TechFest web application! This project showcases a modern, high-performance website built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is designed to highlight our technical skills, UI/UX design, and ability to deliver a scalable, production-ready solution for large events.

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Blazing Fast Development**: Powered by Vite for instant hot reloads and lightning-fast builds.
- **Component-Driven**: Modular React components for maintainability and reusability.
- **Beautiful UI**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive, and modern design.
- **Full-Stack Ready**: Includes a Node.js backend (`server-side/`) for API and server logic.
- **Optimized Assets**: Efficient use of images, videos, and static resources.
- **Deployment-Ready**: Vercel configuration for seamless cloud deployment.
- **Clean Code**: Follows best practices for readability and collaboration.

## 🏆 Tech Stack

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hi! I'm Somesh, a 3rd-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in modern web development, design systems, and scalable frontend architectures.

I led the design, development, and maintenance of the official **TechVibes 2025** website — our college's premier technical fest.  
This project involved building a dynamic and visually engaging platform to showcase event schedules, handle registrations, and post live updates.  

🚀 As a result, we saw a significant increase in participant engagement and smoother communication during the fest.  
It was a hands-on opportunity to apply my skills in **React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and deployment workflows**, while collaborating closely with our college’s technical committee.
